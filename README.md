# AI-nception
## Allowing anyone to use AI to allow anyone to interact with AI

AI-nception is a cute little hackathon project for HackMIT! ![](https://hackmit.org/images/Main2/logo.svg)

AI-nception uses AI to code up AI-powered apps from just text instructions. It enables anyone, without any coding experience required (though coding experience will help edit it after AI-nception generates a fully working app), to build AI-apps, democratizing the power of creating with generative AI.
